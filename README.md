# SIG: Web - website202x (up to date! (and futureproofed!)) - a super duper amazing project
This is the website of [CompSoc Edinburgh](https://comp-soc.com), the world's largest technology society, and it was built by SIG:Web.

## Running locally on your computer
It uses Jekyll. It also works very amazingly nicely with Docker.

If you use Linux or macOS, run `docker-run.sh`. It will automatically build, server, and watch the directory for changes and it will listen on port 4000. 

If you're on Windows, reconsider your life decisions.

## Running locally on your computer without Docker
If you have `bundler` installed, type:

- `bundle`, to install the Gemfile packages
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` to host a local server that will watch the directory for changes

Thanks for visiting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

CompSoc <3 you :))
